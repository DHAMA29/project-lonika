# Fix Category Filtering for Dynamically Loaded Categories

## Problem Description

After successfully implementing the "lainnya" (more) button to load additional categories from the database, the newly loaded category buttons were not triggering the filtering functionality when clicked. They would not navigate to `/categories/id` URLs as expected.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was with **event listener attachment**:

1. **Original Implementation**: Used direct event binding `$('input[name="categoryFilter"]').on('change.ajaxFilter', ...)`
2. **Problem**: Direct binding only applies to elements that exist at the time the event listener is attached
3. **Issue**: Dynamically loaded categories from AJAX didn't have event listeners attached
4. **Previous Attempt**: Tried to re-call `setupCategoryFilters()` after loading new categories, but this was inefficient and prone to conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Event Delegation

Changed from direct event binding to **event delegation**:

**Before:**

```javascript
$('input[name="categoryFilter"]').on("change.ajaxFilter", function () {
    // Event handler
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
$(document).on(
    "change.ajaxFilter",
    'input[name="categoryFilter"]',
    function () {
        // Event handler
    }
);
```

### 2. Benefits of Event Delegation

-   **Automatic Coverage**: Event listeners automatically apply to all current AND future elements matching the selector
-   **No Re-attachment Needed**: New categories loaded via AJAX immediately inherit the event handlers
-   **Performance**: More efficient than repeatedly attaching/detaching event listeners
-   **Reliability**: Eliminates timing issues and event conflicts

### 3. Code Changes Made

#### File: `resources/views/peminjaman/partials/scripts.blade.php`

1. **Updated `setupAjaxCategoryFilters` function:**

    ```javascript
    // OLD: Direct binding
    $('input[name="categoryFilter"]').off('change.ajaxFilter');
    $('input[name="categoryFilter"]').on('change.ajaxFilter', function() {

    // NEW: Event delegation
    $(document).off('change.ajaxFilter', 'input[name="categoryFilter"]');
    $(document).on('change.ajaxFilter', 'input[name="categoryFilter"]', function() {
    ```

2. **Removed unnecessary re-attachment:**

    ```javascript
    // REMOVED: No longer needed
    // setupCategoryFilters(); // after loading new categories

    // ADDED: Simple confirmation
    console.log(
        "Categories loaded successfully. Event delegation will handle new buttons."
    );
    ```

3. **Enhanced debugging:**
    ```javascript
    console.log("Element that triggered change:", this);
    console.log("Extracted category ID:", categoryId);
    console.log("About to call filterProductsByCategory with:", categoryId);
    ```

## Testing & Verification

### Created Test Page: `test-event-delegation.html`

-   Tests both initial and dynamically loaded categories
-   Verifies event delegation works correctly
-   Provides real-time console output
-   Simulates actual category loading process

### Expected Behavior Now:

1. ✅ Initial categories trigger filtering correctly
2. ✅ Click "lainnya" loads additional categories
3. ✅ **NEW**: Dynamically loaded categories automatically trigger filtering
4. ✅ All categories navigate to correct `/categories/id` URLs
5. ✅ No JavaScript errors or event conflicts

## Impact

-   **User Experience**: Seamless category filtering for all categories, regardless of when they were loaded
-   **Code Maintenance**: Cleaner, more robust event handling
-   **Performance**: Improved efficiency with single event delegation vs multiple event attachments
-   **Reliability**: Eliminates race conditions and timing issues

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: Dynamically loaded categories now properly trigger filtering to `/categories/id` URLs using event delegation pattern.

The filtering system now works consistently for both initially loaded and AJAX-loaded categories without requiring manual event listener re-attachment.
